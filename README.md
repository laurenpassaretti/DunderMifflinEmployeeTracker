#Dunder Mifflin - Scranton Employee Directory
We were tasked to create and deploy a React application that was an employee or user directory. The user should be able to search for a particular employee, or be able to sort (ascending and descending) at least two rows. 

I utilized both React and Express.js

This assignment was really exciting for me and I enjoyed working with React. I learned a lot, and I am excited to continue growing my knowledge. 

Here is the link to the deployed application:
